			<p>Pure Digital Library is a scientific paper data management system, where users can search for scientific paper as well as like, view, download and add comments to them. Our main aim is to create a user friendly digital library service where social aspects are also added to a regular digital library by adding a like, comment option. The search bar has various options to filter and sort the results. Users are able to see the paperâ€™s publication date, place, citation number, page number, number of views, and the number of downloads. In the system, a membership is required to access library data. Users must enter their name(s), surname, e-mail address, password and a unique username during the sign up process. After the login process, user can search for papers.  In this system there are different user types such as, authors, reviewers, editors, or just a regular user. Each of them will have different roles with different functionality. For instance, during the sign up process, in addition to features that are shown above, students and teachers (regular users) could enter their institutions. Moreover, some users can subscribe to scientific journals. These users are considered as journal subscribers. To distinguish journal subscribers, subscription identity numbers are assigned to them. Each type of users can make comments on papers and journals. These comments can be seen by only library members. The sources are downloadable for members and their download count are also stored. This count also will be displayed to library members. Pages of the papers are calculated. The number of views of each paper is also counted when the users open them. Users can search sources according to their titles, release year, author, and institution of the author and/or language. Users can also distinguish the sources by checking the conference that the source is submitted or published. Editors and reviewers decide the publication status of the source. In addition to these options, results can be sorted according to like number, download count, page number, comment number and view count.</p>
